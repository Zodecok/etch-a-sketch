Planning

Getting boxes:
    Have the function that resets everthing
    Have the input being a variable that is used in the play function, and then can be changed later for human input
    create the number of divs squared and wrap it and have all divs being equal flex to fill the space 
    Have the container not be changing in size

Lighting up:
    Have a class that is added to the list when it is hovered over, and toggle it, see if that works, if not, then you will have to add another event listener for when they leave the square

can make it reactive later if I feel like it. Like flex to the size of the container. But I think I will just stick with this for now
